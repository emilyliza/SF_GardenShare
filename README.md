This is my 3rd project as a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. SF GardenShare enables users to sign in, CRUD a garden space profile and place their listing on a google map. For me, this was primarily an exercise in learning the Mean stack. Technologies used: AngularJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, angular-google maps.

Next Steps:

geocode address data

add a second type of user (gardener)

add the ability for users to contact each other via the app

restyle layout using bootstrap
